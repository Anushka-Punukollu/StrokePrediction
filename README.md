# Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning

The Global Stroke Factsheet released in 2022 reveals that lifetime risk of developing a stroke has increased by 50% over the last 17 years and now 1 in 4 people is estimated to have a stroke in their lifetime - that means approximately 2 billion people worldwide. Stroke is a serious and potentially life-threatening medical condition that occurs when blood flow to the brain is disrupted, either by a blockage or a rupture of a blood vessel. 

Early prediction of stroke can be critical in preventing or minimizing the damage caused by an attack. Machine Learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, including medical records, genetic information, lifestyle factors, and imaging data, to identify patterns and risk factors that may indicate an increased likelihood of stroke. By accurately predicting stroke risk, healthcare providers can implement preventive measures such as medication, lifestyle changes, and targeted interventions to reduce the likelihood of an attack. This can potentially save lives, reduce disability, and improve the quality of life for those at risk of stroke.
